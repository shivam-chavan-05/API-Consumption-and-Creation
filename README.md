## API Consumption and Creation with Python
#### Overview
This project demonstrates how to consume an external API using Python and create a simple API with Flask.

##### Key Steps:
API Consumption: Fetched data from the Stack Exchange API using Python's requests library, extracting and displaying relevant information.

Flask API Setup: Built a basic Flask web server that responds to requests.

Database Integration: Used SQLAlchemy to create a database, defining a simple Drink model and performing CRUD operations.

HTTP Methods: Implemented core HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to interact with the API.

##### Key Learnings:
Consuming and integrating external APIs with Python.

Setting up a Flask API with database support.

Using HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
